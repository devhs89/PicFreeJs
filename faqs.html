    <h4>GET STARTED</h4>
    <p>What is PicFree?</p>
    <section>PicFree is a vibrant community of creatives, sharing royalty-free HD photos and stock images,
      new illustration vectors, high-quality videos, popular animated GIFs and best audio music that
      are free to download. All contents are released under the PicFree License, which makes them safe
      to use without attribution - even for commercial purposes.
    </section>
    <p>How can I upload photos, videos, music, illustrations, GIFs and other media on PicFree?</p>
    <section>To upload photos, videos, music, illustrations, GIFs, sound-effects and vectors,, you need to be
      a registered user on PicFree first. If you are not yet registered, you can sign up here. Once you have
      signed up you can upload any media by clicking the "upload” button in the top right corner of the page.
    </section>
    <p>Can I use your photos, videos, music, illustrations, GIFs and other media? </p>
    <section>You can copy, modify, distribute, and use the PicFREE's royalty-free stock photos, illustrations, videos,
      music, GIFs, vectors and sound effects, even for commercial purposes. However, depicted content may still be
      protected
      by trademarks, publicity or privacy rights.
    </section>
    <p>Are all photos, videos, music, illustrations, GIFs and other media on PicFREE free to use?</p>
    <section>PicFREE photos, illustrations, videos, music, animated GIFs, vectors and sound effects are free to use for
      commercial and non-commercial purposes. However, depicted content may still be protected by trademarks, publicity
      or privacy rights. While no payment is needed to use the media, it is always appreciated when you credit the
      contributor as it provides exposure to their work and encourages them to continue sharing. While not required,
      we also allow users to make donations to contributors. Find out how below under Downloads and Donations.
    </section>
    <p>How can I download images, videos, music, and other media from PicFREE?</p>
    <section class="mb-4">To download any media (stock photos, illustrations, videos, music, animated GIFs, vectors and
      sound
      effects),
      go to the specific media page of the content that you want to download, then click the ‘Free Download' button.
      Choose
      the size and click ‘Download'. You will need to sign up to download full resolution photos and videos,
    </section>
    <h4>LICENSE AND TERMS</h4>
    <p>Can I use media without making any alterations to it?</p>
    <section>Yes. When you download PicFree content, you can use it in its original form (i.e., without altering it).
      The only exceptions are:<br>

      - Don't sell copies of content without meaningful alterations e.g. don't sell an exact copy of a stock photo as
      posters, prints, greeting cards, mugs, t-shirts or other similar items of merchandise .<br>

      - Don't redistribute or sell PicFree as digital content or as digital wallpapers (such as on stock media websites
      or as NFTs)
    </section>
    <p>If I do wish to use media on a product like those mentioned above, how much do I need to alter it?</p>
    <section>The golden rule of thumb is to consider whether the product you are creating effectively amounts to
      reselling the original image and whether a reasonable person on the street would look side-by-side
      at the original image and your product and consider them to be identical (or effectively identical). <br>

      If you've made some creative effort to incorporate a photo into a broader design, this should generally be
      sufficient (see examples in the next question below). Applying a filter over a
      photo, minor cropping, or simply changing some colours will generally not be enough.
    </section>
    <p>What are examples of significantly altered media?</p>
    <section>- Adding the photo to a video montage.<br>

      - Incorporation into a greater work (e.g. adding it to a book, app, game).<br>

      - Adding the photo to any work where the reason someone would buy it is because of what you have made, rather than
      the image.
    </section>
    <p>Can I sell PicFree media on canvas or wallpaper?</p>
    <section>Digitally printing images onto a canvas or wallpaper for sale is not allowed if there were no significant
      changes made to the image(s).
    </section>
    <p>Can I use PicFree images as a logo for my brand (and potentially sell merchandise with this logo)?</p>
    <section class="mb-4">Yes, you can use PicFree images for your logo. However, you cannot claim ownership of any
      images on
      PicFree, which means you cannot register your logo as a trademark. Kindly check our Terms of
      Service for further information.
